# TO DO
- [x] HTML
  - [ ] Add option to write your own mold
- [x] CSS
- [x] JS (without database)
- [x] Database
- [ ] Fix code for distances outside 4-9 meters
- [x] Local storage
  - [x] Putter mold
  - [x] Number of putts
  - [x] Distances
  - [ ] User in summary
  - [ ] Username
- [ ] Visualization
  - [x] C1X percentage (pie chart)
  - [ ] C1X percentage (circular)
  - [ ] Percentage for each distance (bar chart)
- [ ] User authentication?
  - [ ] My putters


## IDEAS
- Restructure to have one document for each putting session?
- Possibility to add timestamp (as an ID?)
- Possible to edit individual sessions later in the database (e.g. if someone mistyped their putter)
- Variable number of fields (based on distances putted). Could make it easier to expand to other distances?
